# shanbay-ext
The project is developed mainly for improvement of the feature 'spot check' for Shanbay.  
It's for personal usage for now, so it's not yet that user friendly.  

The Automation test tool puppeteer is used to interact with Shanbay website.  

Spot check can be done with this tool smoothly, and Webster dictionary can be checked for better review. And for words that has been checked by this program and marked memorized, they will not show for a while.

#### TODO list:

Save memorized words and don't show again for a while.
